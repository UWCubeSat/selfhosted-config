# Apache and/or php presumably uses the Host header to decide where to redirect requests, but still
# thinks they're http. As a result, it bypasses nginx's default reverse proxy 301 Location
# rewriting, which assumes that the proxied server is na√Øve enough to just redirect to the same host
# that you wrote in proxy_pass. Workaround below:
proxy_redirect http://$host https://$host;
